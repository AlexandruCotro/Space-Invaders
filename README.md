This project is a Java-based version of the classic arcade game Space Invaders, where players take control of a spaceship and defend the planet from waves of alien invaders. Built using Java's AWT and Swing libraries, this game offers a simple yet engaging experience with familiar gameplay mechanics.


You play as the pilot of a spaceship, tasked with defending your base from an onslaught of alien enemies. The aliens move in horizontal lines, gradually descending towards your base. As the player, you can move left and right to dodge enemy fire and line up your shots. The objective is to destroy all enemies before they reach the bottom of the screen.

Features
Player Movement: Control your spaceship using the left and right arrow keys, providing fluid movement to dodge enemy attacks.
Shooting Mechanism: Fire lasers at the enemies using the spacebar, allowing you to destroy them one by one.
Multiple Enemy Waves: The game features waves of alien enemies that increase in number and speed as you progress, making the game more challenging over time.
Collision Detection: The game has built-in collision detection, ensuring that when your laser hits an enemy, they are destroyed.
Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the playerâ€™s score, which increases as more enemies are destroyed. The score serves as a measure of your performance.
Game Over Mechanism: If any enemy reaches the bottom of the screen, the game ends, and the player loses. This creates a sense of urgency, forcing players to shoot down enemies quick
